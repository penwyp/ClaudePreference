# Command: m:merge-branch

## Description

The `m:merge-branch` command simplifies the process of merging a branch into your current branch. It provides a safe and controlled way to integrate changes, ensuring that the merge is handled correctly.

This command is a useful alternative to manual merging, as it can help prevent common merge conflicts and errors.

## How to Use

To merge a branch, use the following command, replacing `[branch-name]` with the name of the branch you want to merge:

```bash
/m:merge-branch [branch-name]
```

The command will then initiate the merge process, guiding you through any necessary steps to ensure a clean integration.
