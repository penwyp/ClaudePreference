# Command: m-debate-code

## Description

The `m-debate-code` command provides a platform for in-depth discussions about specific code implementations. By specifying a file path and a topic, you can engage in a debate with two AI agents who will analyze the code and present arguments for and against your proposition.

This command is useful for code reviews, refactoring discussions, or any scenario where you want to critically evaluate a piece of code.

## How to Use

To initiate a code debate, use the following command:

```bash
m-debate-code [file_path] "Your topic"
```

Replace `[file_path]` with the path to the code file you want to discuss and `"Your topic"` with your proposition. The AI agents will then begin a debate, offering insights and different viewpoints on the code.
