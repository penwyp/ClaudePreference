# Command: m:debate-architecture

## Description

The `m:debate-architecture` command facilitates a structured debate about architectural decisions. It allows you to define a topic and engage with two AI personas, each arguing for or against the proposition. This process helps you explore different perspectives and make more informed architectural choices.

This command is ideal for evaluating new technologies, comparing design patterns, or any situation where a critical examination of architectural options is needed.

## How to Use

To start a debate, use the following command, replacing `"Your topic"` with the architectural proposition you want to discuss:

```bash
/m:debate-architecture "Your topic"
```

The command will then initiate a debate between two AI agents, presenting arguments and counterarguments to help you thoroughly analyze the topic.
