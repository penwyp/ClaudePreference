# m-security-scan - Comprehensive Security Scan Workflow

## Overview

`m-security-scan` is a comprehensive security vulnerability scanning and assessment workflow that checks for security issues in dependencies, code, authentication mechanisms, and data handling processes. The command supports different scan scopes, from dependency checks to full security audits.

## Usage

```bash
/m-security-scan [scope]
```

## Parameter Details

- `scope` (optional): The scope of the scan.
  - **Default Behavior**: Scans the entire codebase.
  - **Supported Scopes**:
    - `dependencies` - Scans only dependencies.
    - `auth` - Focuses on authentication mechanisms.
    - `data-handling` - Security of data processing.
    - `full` - Comprehensive security assessment.
    - **Specific Paths**: `src/api`, `config/`, etc.

- **Password Policy**: Assesses password storage and validation.
- **Session Management**: Analyzes session creation, maintenance, and destruction.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Checks MFA implementation.

### 3. Data Handling Check
- **Input Validation**: Checks validation and sanitization of user input.
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Analyzes the security of database queries.
- **XSS Protection**: Checks for cross-site scripting protection.
- **Data Encryption**: Assesses encryption of sensitive data.

### 4. Security Report Generation
- **Risk Rating**: Assesses risk levels according to CVSS standards.
- **Fix Recommendations**: Provides specific fix solutions.
- **Prioritization**: Ranks issues based on risk level.
- **Compliance Check**: Checks against security standards.

### 5. Application of Security Fixes
- **Automatic Fixes**: Applies fixes that can be safely automated.
- **Manual Fix Guidance**: Provides detailed steps for manual fixes.
- **Configuration Updates**: Updates security configurations.
- **Dependency Updates**: Upgrades vulnerable dependencies.

## Security Check Categories

### Dependency Security
- **Known Vulnerabilities**: Checks CVE databases.
- **License Issues**: Checks dependency licenses.
- **Outdated Dependencies**: Identifies dependencies that need updating.
- **Malicious Packages**: Checks for suspicious third-party packages.

### Code Security
- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection.
- **Cross-Site Scripting**: XSS, CSRF attack protection.
- **Access Control**: Permission validation and authorization checks.
- **Data Leaks**: Checks for sensitive information leaks.

### Configuration Security
- **Default Credentials**: Checks for default usernames and passwords.
- **Debug Mode**: Debug configurations in production environments.
- **Log Security**: Leaks of sensitive information in logs.
- **Network Configuration**: Port, protocol, and encryption settings.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Weak Passwords**: Password complexity and storage.
- **Session Fixation**: Protection against session hijacking.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Vertical and horizontal permission checks.
- **Token Security**: JWT, API key management.
