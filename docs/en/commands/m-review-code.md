## Expected Outcome

### Code Review Report
```markdown
# Code Review Report - Auth Module
Review Time: 2025-01-15 14:30:00
Target: src/auth
Depth: Deep Review
Focus: Security

## Executive Summary
- Overall Score: B+ (82/100)
- Key Issues: 3 high-risk, 5 medium-risk
- Priority: Immediately fix high-risk issues
- Estimated Fix Time: 2-3 days

## Functional Completeness
‚úÖ **Overall Assessment**: Good (85%)

### Implemented Features
- User registration and login
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- Permission validation

### Issues Found
1. **Medium Risk**: Password reset function lacks frequency limiting.
   - Location: `src/auth/passwordReset.js:45`
   - Impact: Could be used for spamming.
   - Suggestion: Add a rate-limiting mechanism.

2. **Low Risk**: Login failure limit is too lenient.
   - Location: `src/auth/login.js:32`
   - Impact: Brute-force attack risk.
   - Suggestion: Lower the failure threshold.

## Critical Bugs
üö® **Found 3 high-risk issues**

### High-Risk Issues
1. **SQL Injection Risk**
   - Location: `src/auth/userService.js:78`
   - Code: `query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + email + "'"`
   - Risk: Database information leakage.
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries.

2. **Hardcoded Secret Key**
   - Location: `src/auth/jwtService.js:12`
   - Code: `const SECRET_KEY = "hardcoded_secret_123"`
   - Risk: Tokens can be arbitrarily forged.
   - Fix: Use environment variables.

3. **Unvalidated Redirect**
   - Location: `src/auth/authController.js:156`
   - Code: `res.redirect(req.query.returnUrl)`
   - Risk: Open redirect attack.
   - Fix: Validate redirect URL against a whitelist.

### Medium-Risk Issues
1. **Session Fixation Vulnerability** (src/auth/sessionManager.js:34)
2. **Logging of Sensitive Information** (src/auth/logger.js:67)
3. **Missing CSRF Protection** (src/auth/middleware.js:23)

## Code Smells
‚ö†Ô∏è **Multiple design issues found**

### Key Issues
1. **Long Method**: `validateUserCredentials()` method is too long (120 lines).
2. **Duplicated Code**: Input validation logic is duplicated in multiple files.
3. **High Coupling**: AuthController directly depends on database operations.
4. **Lack of Abstraction**: Similar validation logic is not abstracted into a common interface.

### Improvement Suggestions
1. Split the long method into smaller methods.
2. Create a common utility class for input validation.
3. Introduce the repository pattern to decouple data access.
4. Create a validation interface and implementation classes.

## Third-party Opportunities

### Recommended Replacements
1. **Custom JWT implementation ‚Üí jsonwebtoken**
   - Benefit: More secure implementation, better maintenance.
   - Risk: Requires migration of existing code.
   - Priority: High.

2. **Custom password hashing ‚Üí bcrypt**
   - Benefit: Industry standard, better security.
   - Risk: Performance impact needs evaluation.
   - Priority: High.

3. **Custom validation ‚Üí joi**
   - Benefit: Better validation features, less code.
   - Risk: Learning curve.
   - Priority: Medium.
